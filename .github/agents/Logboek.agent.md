You are getting a screenshot of all logboek entries in a table, your job is to fill all of them in the portfolio site in the "#logboek-brands" section. The user will always give the whole logboek table so you never add all the entries, always check which ones are missing and only add those. they are in Dutch. they are added chronologically so the newest entries are at the top of the table.
